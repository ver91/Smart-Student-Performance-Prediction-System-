# Smart Student Performance Prediction System

# 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT:

- Student performance is influenced by multiple academic and behavioral factors.
- Faculty may find it difficult to identify students who are at risk at an early stage.
- A data-driven system can help predict student performance.
- The system can provide recommendations for improving student outcomes.

# 2. PROPOSED SOLUTION:

- Collect student-related information.
- Process the entered data.
- Use a Machine Learning model to predict performance.
- Classify students based on predicted performance.
- Generate intelligent recommendations.
- Display the results through a user-friendly Tkinter interface.

# 3. PROCESS FLOW:

               Start
                 ↓
        Enter Student Details
                 ↓
           Validate Input
                 ↓
           Preprocess Data
                 ↓
           ML Prediction
                 ↓
      Determine Performance Level
                 ↓
      Generate AI Recommendation
                 ↓
            Display Result
                 ↓
                End

# 4. PROJECT MAPPING:

| V-Model Stage | Smart Student Project |
|---|---|
| Requirement Analysis | Identify student performance problem |

# 5. PROJECT - MODULAR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT:

Create separate functions:

    get_student_data()
    calculate_average()
    calculate_performance()
    display_result()

# 6. REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS:

## 6.1 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

The system should:

- Accept student details.
- Validate user inputs.
- Store/process student information.
- Preprocess input data.
- Apply the trained ML model.
- Predict student performance.
- Generate recommendations.
- Display results through the GUI.
- Handle invalid inputs.
- Provide a reset/clear option.

## 6.2 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

The application should be:

- User-friendly
- Easy to understand
- Fast in generating predictions
- Reliable
- Maintainable
- Scalable
- Secure with respect to student data
- Easy to test

## 6.3 IDENTIFY THE USER:

Primary users may include:

- Faculty
- Academic coordinators
- Mentors
- Students

## 6.4 USER REQUIREMENT:

The user should be able to:

- Enter student information.
- Submit the information for analysis.
- View predicted performance.
- Understand the student's risk level.
- Receive improvement recommendations.

## 6.5 IDENTIFY SYSTEM INPUTS:

The initial system can use:

- Student ID
- Student Name
- Attendance Percentage
- Study Hours per Day
- Internal Assessment Marks
- Assignment Completion Percentage
- Previous Academic Performance

## 6.6 IDENTIFY SYSTEM OUTPUTS:

### 6.6.1 PERFORMANCE PREDICTION:

- Excellent
- Good
- Average
- At Risk

### 6.6.2 ADDITIONAL OUTPUT:

- Prediction score/probability
- Risk level
- Key factors affecting performance
- Recommended actions

# Example:

**Prediction:** Good Performance

**Risk Level:** Low

**Recommendation:** Maintain current study pattern and attendance
